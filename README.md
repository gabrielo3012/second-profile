# second-profile

Small project that will serve as a sort of résumé. I will initially use html and css but I also intend to add some interactive JavaScript as well.
I'll be using sample images in order to create it at first. However, I will definitely add personal stuff later since it is a personal profile.
And it is a one-hundred-percent-responvive project :)
